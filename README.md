# JDBC
You need to create a console application based on the database from homework 1, which:


- connects to the database

- allows you to perform CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations;

- output to console:


          - salary (amount) of all developers of a separate project;
     
          - list of developers of a separate project;
     
          - a list of all Java developers;
     
          - a list of all middle developers;
     
          - list of projects in the following format: creation date - project name 
          - the amount of developers on this project.
